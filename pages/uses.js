              Mailbox
            </Link>
            , remember that? After it was shutdown I moved on to Outlook which
            had updated by acquiring something else, but on MacOS it was very
            slow and then I discovered Spark Mail in 2018 and haven't looked
            back. Its two most important features to me are the snoozing of
            messages (inbox zero frequently/messages come back at relevant times
            or as reminders) and being able to comment on email as a team
            outside of the thread (no more forwarding to team members that can
            help). I haven't tried those other two hipster email services yet,
            because 1) I need my company email and 2) I don't get <i>that</i>{" "}
            much email to make me think the prices are worth it. That's where
            Spark Mail's monthly cost for team interaction is much more valuable
            to me.

            Inspired by a friend, I <i>try</i> to keep a few daily notes.
            Whether keeping tabs of to-dos as they come up, recording a log of
            my process/steps during troubleshooting a bug, or noting restaurants
            while traveling, nvALT makes it quick and easy to edit a text file
            stored in Dropbox. Since I'm not doing this from my phone very
            often, when I do I just use the Dropbox iOS app which allows you to
            edit plain text files fairly easily. And yes, there are apps that
            specialize in doing all the things I mentioned just now, but plain
            text means it'll basically work forever.

            I'm pretty flexible in being in whatever project management tool a
            team is using, but my favorite is Basecamp. I like their
            message/comment thread feature way more than messy email threads,
            adore their tidy to-do management, and often use the email
            forwarding feature to centralize conversations and get us back on
            track. I've also found that people who don't use it often appreciate
            the fact they get emails that they can respond to from the system
            without ever having to log into the app. And all for a flat rate
            $99/mo. It might seem like a lot for a team of 3 or 4, but for a
            team of 10+ it's a steal.

          </p>
          <p className="leading-normal">
            We've had a 5.5 quart round dutch oven from Le Creuset for about 10
            years now, and use it almost daily. We also were gifted a gigantic 9
            quart one more recently from someone combining kitchens with their
            significant other. They're just simple, solid pieces of cookware
            with a billion uses. We use them for soups, searing, rice, and
            they're perfect at trapping in steam when making a rustic loaf of
            bread. I'm not too familiar with other brands, but I'm sure they
            good as well. I'd only suggest making sure the one you get has a
            metal knob on top so that it can withstand higher oven temps.

          <p className="leading-normal">
            After our initial "non-stick" cookware from our wedding registry
            wore out (and was potentially toxic?), we began investing in
            All-Clad pans. You don't need the non-stick for most things and the
            3-ply structure of these pans distribute heat much better. Like the
            Le Creuset, I think these will pretty much last for life. We've only
            ever got the D3 series, but I've heard good things about the copper
            core line, and may invest in one or two of those eventually.

            Our most recent kitchen addition. After baking more loaves I was
            looking to upgrade to a longer serrated knife that could handle a
            thick crusty bread a bit better. Originally I learned about Misen
            because of their chef's knife from Kenji Lopez-Alt. Seeing how nice
            this knife is, I'm interested in trying our the chef's knife soon.
            Bonus: They offer free sharpening if you pay for shipping and
            handling.
