The wonderful month of May began this week, and so did National Bike Month! Here in Toledo, Ohio, the weather has been perfect for commuting all week. This year, after some time and experience gained from last year, I thought I'd share a bit about my biking shenanigans.

Beginning last spring, I became fairly interested in the idea of bike commuting. The fall before, I had got a new job that was about five miles from where my wife and I were living at the time. Already having a bike, the biggest obstacle seemed removed.

The thing that finally pushed me to do it, was having a coworker who lived very close expressing interest in commuting also. We made the plans and mapped our route. Because I use <a href="http://strava.com/" title="Strava" target="_blank">Strava</a>, I actually have our first ride to work recorded!

**Having a partner to do this with the first time was huge. That'd probably be one of my top suggestions for anyone interested in bike commuting.** Even though my friend eventually stopped commuting with me, I had become comfortable enough with the route and traffic conditions to continue doing it on my own for the rest of the year.

Over the year, I learned a lot, invested in new gear and eventually a new bike (I'll be posting about all this later on...), and racked up over **600 miles in commuting alone!**

If you've been wanting to dabble in bike commuting, when better to do it than during national bike month? Replacing one trip a week (to work, the grocery store, etc...) is a great place to be.

Find a partner and get out there!
